# Bisection-Method
A method for finding root.
It separates the interval and
subdivides the interval in which the root of the equation lies. The principle behind this
method is the intermediate theorem for continuous functions. It works by narrowing the
gap between the positive and negative intervals until it closes in on the correct answer.
This method narrows the gap by taking the average of the positive and negativeÂ intervals.
